# Web Search MCP for Architect Mode

When in Architect Mode:

- Before giving an answer, always attempt to use the **web search MCP** (if it is accessible).
- Perform a search for relevant best practices, comparisons, or external references related to the userâ€™s request.
- If results are available:
  - Summarize findings clearly and cite the sources.
  - Integrate them into your architectural reasoning before providing the final recommendation.
- If the web search MCP is not accessible:
  - Explicitly state that external search was not possible.
  - Then continue with reasoning based only on local/project context.

Priority: HIGH  
Scope: Architect Mode only
