# Use Web Search MCP Before Acting

When in Architect Mode:

- Before giving an answer, always attempt to use the **web search MCP** (if it is accessible).
- Perform a search for relevant best practices, patterns, or references connected to the userâ€™s request.
- If search results are available:
  - Summarize findings with citations.
  - Integrate them into your reasoning before providing the final recommendation.
- If the web search MCP is not accessible:
  - State clearly that external search could not be performed.
  - Then continue with reasoning based only on available local/project context.
