"""
Infrastructure bootstrap utilities for integration tests.

Detects whether core dependencies (RabbitMQ and Postgres) are reachable on the
configured host:port and, if both are down, starts the dev stack via Docker Compose
without rebuilding. Provides clear failure instructions when auto-start is not possible
or if only a subset of services is down.
