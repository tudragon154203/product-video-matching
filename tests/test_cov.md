## Conclusion

The current test coverage state requires immediate attention, with no services meeting the 90% threshold. The critical services (product-segmentor, evidence-builder, vision-embedding) pose significant production risks due to insufficient testing.

However, the foundation is strong - unit tests exist for most services, and some services like vision-keypoint demonstrate that high coverage is achievable. With focused effort on the identified priorities, the system can reach 90% coverage within 12 weeks.

The key to success is addressing the PyTorch dependency issues, standardizing testing patterns across services, and implementing a robust integration testing framework. This will provide confidence for rapid development cycles while maintaining system reliability.
