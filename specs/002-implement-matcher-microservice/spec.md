# Feature Specification: Implement Matcher Microservice

**Feature Branch**: `002-implement-matcher-microservice`  
**Created**: Friday, October 3, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "implement matcher microservice following PRD at docs\sprint\matcher sprint_2_matcher_microservice_implementation.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Describe the main user journey for the matcher microservice based on the PRD at `docs\sprint\matcher sprint_2_matcher_microservice_implementation.md`]

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Provide acceptance scenarios based on the PRD at `docs\sprint\matcher sprint_2_matcher_microservice_implementation.md`]

### Edge Cases
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What happens when boundary conditions are met for the matcher microservice, based on the PRD?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How does the matcher microservice handle error scenarios, based on the PRD?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: System MUST provide specific capabilities for the matcher microservice, based on the PRD at `docs\sprint\matcher sprint_2_matcher_microservice_implementation.md`]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Identify key entities and their attributes for the matcher microservice, based on the PRD at `docs\sprint\matcher sprint_2_matcher_microservice_implementation.md`]
