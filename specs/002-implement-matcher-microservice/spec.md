# Feature Specification: Implement Matcher Microservice

**Feature Branch**: `002-implement-matcher-microservice`  
**Created**: Friday, October 3, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "implement matcher microservice following PRD at docs\sprint\matcher sprint_2_matcher_microservice_implementation.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I want the matcher microservice to accurately identify product matches in video frames so that I can provide relevant video content to users.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a product image and a video frame, **When** the matcher microservice processes them, **Then** it should return a match score and bounding box if a match is found.
2. **Given** a product image and a video frame with no visual match, **When** the matcher microservice processes them, **Then** it should return a low match score or no match.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the product image is of poor quality? The system should still attempt to match but may return lower confidence scores.
- How does the system handle multiple products in a single video frame? It should identify all matching products.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The matcher microservice MUST accept product image data and video frame data as input.
- **FR-002**: The matcher microservice MUST utilize deep learning embeddings (CLIP) and traditional computer vision techniques (AKAZE/SIFT + RANSAC) for matching.
- **FR-003**: The matcher microservice MUST output a match score, bounding box coordinates, and confidence level for each identified match.
- **FR-004**: The matcher microservice MUST be scalable to handle a high volume of matching requests.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Product**: Represents an e-commerce product with an associated image.
- **VideoFrame**: Represents a single frame extracted from a video.
- **MatchResult**: Contains the match score, bounding box, and confidence level for a product-video frame match.
