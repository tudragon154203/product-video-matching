# Implementation Plan: TikTok Platform Crawler

**Branch**: `feat/tiktok-crawler` | **Date**: 2025-09-26 | **Spec**: `specs/feat-tiktok-crawler/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/feat-tiktok-crawler/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path → SUCCESS
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION) → SUCCESS
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document → SUCCESS
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below → PASS
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md → COMPLETED
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md → COMPLETED
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section → PASS
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
Implement TikTok platform crawler integration using existing TikTok Search API at `http://localhost:5680/tiktok/search`. Follows existing YouTube crawler pattern with real-time streaming support, error handling with exponential backoff, and integration into the video-crawler microservice.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**: httpx, sse-starlette, aio-pika, asyncpg, pydantic
**Storage**: PostgreSQL with pgvector
**Testing**: pytest, pytest-asyncio
**Target Platform**: Linux server (Docker)
**Project Type**: microservice (single)
**Performance Goals**: 100-1000 videos/day, real-time streaming
**Constraints**: 50 videos max per search, 7-day data retention
**Scale/Scope**: Medium-scale operations

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **I. Microservice Structure**: Adherence to standardized microservice layout.
- [x] **II. Event Contracts**: All inter-service communication conforms to defined event contracts.
- [x] **III. Testing Discipline**: Prioritization of integration tests, correct test execution, and passing tests.
- [x] **IV. Development Environment & Configuration**: Correct environment setup, configuration management, and efficient development practices.
- [x] **V. Data Flow Enforcement**: Strict adherence to the defined data processing pipeline and technology usage.

**Structure Decision**: Follow existing YouTube crawler pattern within video-crawler microservice

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
Completed - See `research.md` for detailed technical decisions and integration patterns.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
Completed - Generated:
- `data-model.md`: TikTok data entities and database schema (updated to use existing events)
- `contracts/tiktok-api.yaml`: OpenAPI schema for TikTok Search API
- `quickstart.md`: Testing and verification guide

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs:
  - API contract → contract test tasks
  - Data model → database schema update tasks
  - Platform crawler interface → TikTok crawler implementation tasks
  - Integration → RabbitMQ event handler tasks
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models → Services → Handlers
- Mark parallel execution for independent components

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations - design follows existing patterns*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented
