# Feature Specification: TikTok Platform Crawler

**Feature Branch**: `feat/tiktok-crawler`
**Created**: Thursday 25 September 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "use the server in http://localhost:5680/, endpoint /tiktok/search as above in microservice video-crawler to make a tiktok platform crawler. branch name should be feat/tiktok-crawler"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system operator, I want to use the existing TikTok search API to crawl TikTok content, so that I can integrate TikTok data into the product-video matching system.
### Important Notes
- **PHASE 1 SCOPE**: This implementation focuses on searching and retrieving TikTok video metadata from the existing server at `http://localhost:5680/tiktok/search`.
- **OUT OF SCOPE**: Video downloading functionality is NOT part of this sprint but infrastructure will be prepared for future implementation.


### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the TikTok Search API is accessible at `http://localhost:5680/tiktok/search`, **When** a request is made to crawl TikTok content for a specific query, **Then** the system should successfully retrieve a list of TikTok videos.
2. **Given** the TikTok Search API is accessible, **When** a request is made to crawl TikTok content with `numVideos` specified, **Then** the system should attempt to retrieve the specified number of videos (up to 50).
3. **Given** the TikTok Search API is accessible, **When** a request is made to crawl TikTok content with `force_headful` set to `true`, **Then** the system should attempt to use headful browser mode for the search.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the TikTok Search API is unavailable or returns an error?
- How does the system handle rate limits or API usage quotas from the TikTok Search API?
- What happens if the `numVideos` requested exceeds the API's limit (50)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST integrate with the external TikTok Search API at `http://localhost:5680/tiktok/search`.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST be able to send search queries to the TikTok Search API.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST be able to specify the number of videos to retrieve (`numVideos`) when making a search request.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST be able to control the browser execution mode (`force_headful`) for TikTok searches.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST process the `TikTokSearchResponse` and extract relevant video information (id, caption, authorHandle, likeCount, uploadTime, webViewUrl) from the results array.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST handle potential errors and unavailability of the TikTok Search API gracefully.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST be implemented within the `video-crawler` microservice.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST stream search results in real-time as videos are found, rather than waiting for batch completion.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST provide public API access without authentication, implementing appropriate rate limiting to prevent abuse.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The system MUST provide real-time streaming updates as TikTok videos are discovered and processed.
- **NFR-002**: The system MUST implement retry logic with exponential backoff when the TikTok Search API fails, attempting up to 3 retries with 15-second intervals.
- **NFR-003**: The system MUST support medium-scale operations handling 100-1000 videos per day with moderate query frequency.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **TikTokVideo**: Represents a single video retrieved from TikTok, containing attributes:
  - `id` (string): Unique video identifier
  - `caption` (string): Video caption/text content (may be empty)
  - `authorHandle` (string): TikTok username/author handle
  - `likeCount` (number): Number of likes on the video
  - `uploadTime` (string): Video upload timestamp
  - `webViewUrl` (string): Direct URL to view the video on TikTok

**Response Schema**:
- `results` (array): Array of TikTokVideo objects
- `totalResults` (number): Total number of results available
- `query` (string): Original search query executed
- `search_metadata` (object): Execution metadata containing `executed_path`, `execution_time`, and `request_hash`

- Q: What is the scope of this TikTok crawler implementation? ‚Üí A: PHASE 1: Search and metadata retrieval only (video downloading deferred to Phase 2)

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25

- Q: What should be the primary data processing model for the TikTok crawler? ‚Üí A: Real-time streaming of results as videos are found
- Q: When the TikTok Search API fails, what should happen? ‚Üí A: B with 3 attempts, 15 seconds apart
- Q: What level of access should different users have to the TikTok crawler functionality? ‚Üí A: D
- Q: How long should TikTok video data be retained in the system? ‚Üí A: B, similar to youtube platform
- Q: What is the expected maximum scale for TikTok crawling operations? ‚Üí A: B
- **NFR-004**: The system MUST retain TikTok video data for short-term (7 days) similar to YouTube platform data retention policy.
