# Feature Specification: TikTok Platform Crawler

**Feature Branch**: `feat/tiktok-crawler`
**Created**: Thursday 25 September 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "use the server in http://localhost:5680/, endpoint /tiktok/search as above in microservice video-crawler to make a tiktok platform crawler. branch name should be feat/tiktok-crawler"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system operator, I want to use the existing TikTok search API to crawl TikTok content, so that I can integrate TikTok data into the product-video matching system.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the TikTok Search API is accessible at `http://localhost:5680/tiktok/search`, **When** a request is made to crawl TikTok content for a specific query, **Then** the system should successfully retrieve a list of TikTok videos.
2. **Given** the TikTok Search API is accessible, **When** a request is made to crawl TikTok content with `numVideos` specified, **Then** the system should attempt to retrieve the specified number of videos (up to 50).
3. **Given** the TikTok Search API is accessible, **When** a request is made to crawl TikTok content with `force_headful` set to `true`, **Then** the system should attempt to use headful browser mode for the search.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the TikTok Search API is unavailable or returns an error?
- How does the system handle rate limits or API usage quotas from the TikTok Search API?
- What happens if the `numVideos` requested exceeds the API's limit (50)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST integrate with the external TikTok Search API at `http://localhost:5680/tiktok/search`.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST be able to send search queries to the TikTok Search API.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST be able to specify the number of videos to retrieve (`numVideos`) when making a search request.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST be able to control the browser execution mode (`force_headful`) for TikTok searches.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST process the `TikTokSearchResponse` and extract relevant video information (ID, title, URL, thumbnail, author, views, likes, comments, shares, createTime).
- **FR-006**: The system MUST handle potential errors and unavailability of the TikTok Search API gracefully.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST be implemented within the `video-crawler` microservice.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **TikTokVideo**: Represents a single video retrieved from TikTok, containing attributes like ID, title, URL, thumbnail, author, views, likes, comments, shares, and creation time.
