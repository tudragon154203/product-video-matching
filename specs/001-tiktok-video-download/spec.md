# Feature Specification: TikTok Video Download & Keyframe Extraction Integration in video-crawler

**Feature Branch**: `001-tiktok-video-download`
**Created**: Tuesday, September 30, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "tiktok video download and extract keyframes: PRD: TikTok Video Download & Keyframe Extraction Integration in video-crawler 1. Overview The video-crawler service currently supports TikTok search and metadata crawling. It lacks the ability to download TikTok videos and extract keyframes for downstream processing. This PRD specifies integration of yt-dlp for downloading and the existing keyframe_extractor module (already used for YouTube) to process TikTok videos post-download. 2. Goals & Objectives Extend TikTok crawler to support downloading videos from webViewUrl. Automatically extract keyframes from downloaded videos. Save keyframes metadata into the database using video_frame_crud from libs/common-py. Reuse the job/phase/event-driven model from YouTube integration. 3. Functional Requirements Video Download Add TikTokDownloader wrapping yt-dlp.  Store downloaded file in temp/videos/tiktok/. Keyframe Extraction After successful download, trigger keyframe_extractor (reuse length_adaptive_extractor.py). Extract representative frames (configurable interval/length adaptive). Save frames to temp/keyframes/tiktok/{video_id}/. Persist metadata (frame paths, timestamps) into DB via video_frame_crud. Data Model Changes Extend Video model (models/video.py): class Video(BaseModel): id: str url: str title: str | None uploader: str | None download_url: str | None local_path: str | None has_download: bool = False keyframes: list[str] | None # list of saved keyframe paths API & Contracts Extend videos_collections_completed.json and videos_keyframes_ready.json to include: has_keyframes: true/false keyframes_count keyframes_paths (relative paths in storage). Job Flow New job phases: video.download.started video.download.completed video.keyframes.ready On failure: video.download.failed or video.keyframes.failed. 4. Non-Functional Requirements Performance: Extract max 20 keyframes per video (configurable). Resilience: If extraction fails, still persist downloaded=true but has_keyframes=false. Storage: Cleanup videos + keyframes older than 7 days (reuse video_cleanup_service.py). Consistency: Follow identical structure as YouTube download + keyframe path. 5. Architecture & Implementation Plan Downloader Add platform_crawler/tiktok/downloader.py. Wrap yt-dlp with retry/error handling. Crawler Update Modify tiktok_crawler.py: Accept download=True. Call TikTokDownloader. Trigger KeyframeExtractor on local file. Save keyframes metadata in DB. Event Emitter Update event_emitter.py: Emit keyframe events similar to YouTube path (videos_keyframes_ready.json). Database Use video_frame_crud.py for inserting keyframe metadata. Config Add platform_crawler/tiktok/ytdlp_config.py. Add settings for keyframe interval, max frames. Testing Unit tests: Mock yt-dlp. Mock keyframe extractor output. Validate DB insertions. Integration tests: Crawl TikTok URL with download=True. Verify video saved + keyframes extracted + metadata persisted. Contract tests: Validate new schema fields. 6. Dependencies yt-dlp (video download). ffmpeg (required by yt-dlp and keyframe extractor). OpenCV or Pillow (already used in keyframe extractor). 7. Risks TikTok anti-bot measures (may break yt-dlp). Large video storage growth if cleanup fails. 8. Acceptance Criteria Given a TikTok webViewUrl, with download=True: Video downloaded successfully. Keyframes extracted and stored. DB updated with frame paths. Event video.keyframes.ready emitted. With download=False: Only metadata + direct URL returned. Cleanup removes files after 7 days. 9. TDD Workflow Write failing unit tests for TikTok download + keyframe extraction. Implement minimal TikTokDownloader. Implement keyframe extraction hook. Implement DB persistence. Run integration test (search ‚Üí download ‚Üí keyframes ‚Üí DB). Refactor code to align with YouTube flow."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
The `video-crawler` service needs to download TikTok videos from a `webViewUrl` and extract keyframes for further processing, similar to how YouTube videos are handled, to enable product-video matching for TikTok content.

### Acceptance Scenarios


3. **Given** a downloaded TikTok video and extracted keyframes, **When** 7 days pass, **Then** the video and keyframe files are cleaned up from storage.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when TikTok anti-bot measures prevent `yt-dlp` from downloading a video?
- How does the system handle large video storage growth if cleanup fails?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

- **FR-001**: The `video-crawler` service MUST be able to download TikTok videos from a `webViewUrl`.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST extract keyframes from downloaded TikTok videos.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST store downloaded TikTok videos in a temporary location (`temp/videos/tiktok/`).
- **FR-004**: The system MUST save extracted keyframes to a temporary location (`temp/keyframes/tiktok/{video_id}/`).
- **FR-005**: The system MUST persist keyframe metadata (paths, timestamps) into the database.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST extend the `Video` model to include `download_url`, `local_path`, `has_download`, and `keyframes`.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST extend `videos_collections_completed.json` and `videos_keyframes_ready.json` event contracts to include `has_keyframes`, `keyframes_count`, and `keyframes_paths`.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST emit new job phases: `video.download.started`, `video.download.completed`, `video.keyframes.ready`.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST handle download and keyframe extraction failures by emitting `video.download.failed` or `video.keyframes.failed` events.


### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Video**: Represents a TikTok video, including its ID, URL, title, uploader, download URL, local path, download status, and a list of keyframe paths.
- **Keyframe**: Represents an extracted image from a video, with associated metadata like path and timestamp.
