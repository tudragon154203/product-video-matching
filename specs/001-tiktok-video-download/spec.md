# Feature Specification: TikTok Video Download & Keyframe Extraction Integration in video-crawler

**Feature Branch**: `001-tiktok-video-download`
**Created**: Tuesday, September 30, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "tiktok video download and extract keyframes: PRD: TikTok Video Download & Keyframe Extraction Integration in video-crawler 1. Overview The video-crawler service currently supports TikTok search and metadata crawling. It lacks the ability to download TikTok videos and extract keyframes for downstream processing. This PRD specifies integration of yt-dlp for downloading and the existing keyframe_extractor module (already used for YouTube) to process TikTok videos post-download. 2. Goals & Objectives Extend TikTok crawler to support downloading videos from webViewUrl. Automatically extract keyframes from downloaded videos. Save keyframes metadata into the database using video_frame_crud from libs/common-py. Reuse the job/phase/event-driven model from YouTube integration. 3. Functional Requirements Video Download Add TikTokDownloader wrapping yt-dlp.  Store downloaded file in temp/videos/tiktok/. Keyframe Extraction After successful download, trigger keyframe_extractor (reuse length_adaptive_extractor.py). Extract representative frames (configurable interval/length adaptive). Save frames to temp/keyframes/tiktok/{video_id}/. Persist metadata (frame paths, timestamps) into DB via video_frame_crud. Data Model Changes Extend Video model (models/video.py): class Video(BaseModel): id: str url: str title: str | None uploader: str | None download_url: str | None local_path: str | None has_download: bool = False keyframes: list[str] | None # list of saved keyframe paths API & Contracts Extend videos_collections_completed.json and videos_keyframes_ready.json to include: has_keyframes: true/false keyframes_count keyframes_paths (relative paths in storage). Job Flow New job phases: video.download.started video.download.completed video.keyframes.ready On failure: video.download.failed or video.keyframes.failed. 4. Non-Functional Requirements Performance: Extract max 20 keyframes per video (configurable). Resilience: If extraction fails, still persist do... [truncated]

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
The `video-crawler` service needs to download TikTok videos from a `webViewUrl` and extract keyframes for further processing, similar to how YouTube videos are handled, to enable product-video matching for TikTok content.

### Test Video Link
- Test Video: https://www.tiktok.com/@lanxinx/video/7548644205690670337

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** TikTok video URLs are provided, **When** system processes them, **Then** videos are downloaded to DATA_ROOT_CONTAINER/videos/tiktok/ and keyframes extracted to DATA_ROOT_CONTAINER/keyframes/tiktok/{video_id}/.
2. **Given** videos and keyframes are processed, **When** job completes, **Then** metadata is persisted to database with video paths and keyframe information.
3. **Given** videos have been stored for 7 days, **When** cleanup process runs, **Then** video files are removed while keyframe files are kept permanently.
4. **Given** TikTok anti-bot measures block download, **When** download attempts fail, **Then** system logs specific error and continues processing with retry logic.
5. **Given** video cleanup fails, **When** cleanup process runs, **Then** system logs error but maintains normal operation.

### Edge Cases

## Anti-Bot Measures Handling
- **FR-011**: When TikTok anti-bot measures prevent downloading, the system MUST log the failure with specific error details and continue processing the next video in the queue.
- **FR-012**: The system MUST retry failed downloads up to 3 times with exponential backoff before marking them as permanently failed.

## Cleanup Failure Resilience
- **FR-013**: If video cleanup after 7 days fails, the system MUST log the error and continue normal operation, not impact video processing or matching functionality.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

- **FR-001**: The `video-crawler` service MUST be able to download TikTok videos from a `webViewUrl`.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST extract keyframes from downloaded TikTok videos.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST store downloaded TikTok videos in the appropriate video directory (`DATA_ROOT_CONTAINER/videos/tiktok/`) like the YouTube counterpart.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST save extracted keyframes to the keyframe directory (`DATA_ROOT_CONTAINER/keyframes/tiktok/{video_id}/`) like the YouTube counterpart.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST persist keyframe metadata (paths, timestamps) into the database.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST extend the `Video` model to include `download_url`, `local_path`, `has_download`, and `keyframes`.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST implement cleanup logic to remove video files after 7 days (keyframe files are kept permanently).
- **FR-008**: The system MUST handle anti-bot measures by logging specific failure details and continuing processing.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST retry failed downloads up to 3 times with exponential backoff.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST maintain normal operation if cleanup fails, with error logging.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST log specific failure details and continue processing when anti-bot measures block downloads.
- **FR-012**: The system MUST retry failed downloads up to 3 times with exponential backoff before marking them as permanently failed.
- **FR-013**: The system MUST maintain normal operation if cleanup fails, with error logging and no impact on processing functionality.


### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Video**: Represents a TikTok video, including its ID, URL, title, uploader, download URL, local path, download status, and a list of keyframe paths.
- **Keyframe**: Represents an extracted image from a video, with associated metadata like path and timestamp.

- Q: How should the system handle TikTok videos that are unavailable or restricted due to region/country restrictions when using yt-dlp? ‚Üí A: Skip the video with a log entry and continue processing other videos
- Q: What should be the maximum file size limit for TikTok videos that the system will attempt to download? ‚Üí A: 500 MB
