- Sprint 1: Defined microservice specs and the end-to-end video→product matching pipeline boundaries
- Sprint 2: Unified Main API spec and added LLM (Ollama) query normalization/fallback path
- Sprint 3: Revamped contracts and schemas; established stricter validation and versioning plan
- Sprint 4: Added Gemini fallback support in Main API to harden LLM pathways
- Sprint 5: Renamed services for clarity (catalog collector → dropship-product-finder, media ingestion → video-crawler)
- Sprint 6.0: Produced end-to-end data-flow ASCII diagram and validated phase ordering
- Sprint 6.1: Debug and stabilization across services during integration
- Sprint 6.2a: Introduced multiple-events pattern to improve batching and throughput

- Sprint 7: Addressed zero/edge-case handling in the pipeline and contracts
- Sprint 8: Designed Product-Segmentor and adjusted event flow to improve matching precision
- Sprint 9: ✅ COMPLETED - Retired dedicated vector-index service
  - Migrated matcher to consume embeddings directly from storage/DB
  - Removed/deprecated vector-index events and updated dependent services
  - Made Qdrant optional/off by default in dev compose
