# Project Brief

## Overview
Product Video Matching System - An event-driven microservice platform that automatically maps user-generated short videos to sellable products for retailers and marketplaces. The system provides automated video-to-product matching with explainable evidence through a simple API interface.

## Goals
- Build a scalable, event-driven pipeline for video-to-product matching
- Provide explainable evidence for match decisions
- Support multiple marketplaces and video platforms
- Deliver a simple API for match requests and results retrieval
- Ensure high performance and reliability through batching and pre-announce patterns

## Scope
- In-scope: Video ingestion, product catalog acquisition, vision processing (keypoints/embeddings), matching algorithms, evidence generation, API endpoints
- Out-of-scope: Direct marketplace integration beyond eBay, video content analysis beyond product matching, real-time streaming processing
