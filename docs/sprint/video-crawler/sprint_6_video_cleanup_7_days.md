# Sprint 6: Video Cleanup 7 Days Implementation

## Overview
Implemented automatic video cleanup mechanism for the video crawler service to remove videos older than 7 days, preventing excessive disk usage and optimizing storage management.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Video Cleanup
- **7-day retention period**: Videos older than 7 days are automatically deleted
- **Configurable settings**: Can be enabled/disabled via environment variables
- **Integration with download workflow**: Cleanup runs automatically after each successful download
- **Empty directory cleanup**: Removes empty uploader directories after video deletion

### 2. Cleanup Service Components

#### Core Files Created:
- `utils/file_cleanup.py`: Main cleanup utilities and file management
- `services/cleanup_service.py`: Async cleanup service with configuration

#### Key Classes:
- `VideoCleanupManager`: Handles file operations for cleanup
- `VideoCleanupService`: High-level service with async support

### 3. Configuration Options

New environment variables added to `config_loader.py`:
```bash
# Enable/disable automatic cleanup (default: true)
CLEANUP_OLD_VIDEOS=true

# Number of days to keep videos (default: 7)
VIDEO_RETENTION_DAYS=7
```

### 4. Download Workflow Integration

Modified `downloader.py` to:
- Run cleanup automatically after successful downloads
- Include cleanup in the download workflow without affecting download performance
- Handle cleanup errors gracefully without interrupting downloads

### 5. Logging and Monitoring

Comprehensive logging for:
- Cleanup start/end operations
- Files removed and space freed
- Error handling and warnings
- Dry run mode for testing

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Structure
```
services/video-crawler/
├── utils/file_cleanup.py          # Core cleanup utilities
├── services/cleanup_service.py    # Async cleanup service
├── platform_crawler/youtube/downloader/downloader.py  # Integrated cleanup
└── config_loader.py               # Updated with cleanup settings
```

### Cleanup Logic
1. **File Discovery**: Scans video directories recursively
2. **Age Calculation**: Checks file creation time against retention period
3. **Safe Deletion**: Removes files only if they meet age criteria
4. **Space Reporting**: Tracks and reports freed disk space
5. **Directory Cleanup**: Removes empty uploader directories

### Error Handling
- Graceful error handling for file operations
- Logging of cleanup failures without interrupting downloads
- Protection against accidental deletion

## Benefits

### 1. Storage Optimization
- Prevents unlimited growth of video files
- Automatically manages disk space usage
- Configurable retention period

### 2. Performance Improvement
- Reduces I/O overhead from old files
- Frees up disk space for new downloads
- Cleaner directory structure

### 3. Operational Efficiency
- Automatic operation without manual intervention
- Configurable and monitoring-friendly
- Integrates seamlessly with existing workflow

## Testing and Validation

The implementation includes:
- Dry run mode for testing without actual deletion
- Comprehensive logging for monitoring
- Error handling for edge cases
- Integration testing with download workflow

## Usage Examples

### Enable/Disable Cleanup
```bash
# Enable cleanup (default)
CLEANUP_OLD_VIDEOS=true

# Disable cleanup
CLEANUP_OLD_VIDEOS=false
```

### Change Retention Period
```bash
# Keep videos for 14 days instead of 7
VIDEO_RETENTION_DAYS=14
```

### Manual Cleanup
```python
from utils.file_cleanup import cleanup_old_videos

# Dry run to see what would be cleaned up
results = cleanup_old_videos("/path/to/videos", days_to_keep=7, dry_run=True)

# Actual cleanup
results = cleanup_old_videos("/path/to/videos", days_to_keep=7, dry_run=False)
```

## Impact

This implementation significantly improves the video crawler's storage management by:
- Eliminating manual cleanup requirements
- Preventing disk space exhaustion
- Providing automated, configurable retention policies
- Maintaining system stability and performance

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Configurable cleanup schedules (e.g., daily vs. per-download)
- More sophisticated retention policies (e.g., by video size, type)
- Statistics and reporting on cleanup operations
- Integration with external storage monitoring systems
