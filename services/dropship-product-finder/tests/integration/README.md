# Integration Tests

This directory contains integration tests for the `dropship-product-finder` microservice. These tests verify the interactions between different components and external services (e.g., databases, other microservices) within a near-production environment.

Each test module directly under this directory should be named descriptively (e.g., `test_feature_name.py`) and should include `pytestmark = pytest.mark.integration` to ensure proper test filtering.

## External dependencies

The eBay collector suites (`test_ebay_collector_*.py`, `test_e2e_auth.py`) now exercise the real eBay Browse and OAuth APIs. Before running them you must export valid eBay credentials (client ID, client secret, redirect URI, etc.) so that the `config_loader` can build the production or sandbox configuration. Without real credentials the requests will fail with authentication errors.

Be mindful of rate limits when running the tests repeatedlyâ€”the suites intentionally avoid stubbing the Browse API so they can verify end-to-end payloads, which means every run consumes real API calls.
